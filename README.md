# Coding challenge

## Background

We are a new eCommerce portal. In our database, we are starting to store products and carts (1 cart: N products) and we will provide
interfaces to manage them.

We need to provide the below capabilities:
- get all products
- get all products of a single cart
- add a product to a cart

## Challenge

1. Provide interface specifications for the above functions / capabilities.
2. Provide implementation of the formulated specifications.
3. You can assume the products as a static data structure that is initialised when your program runs.

## Language

Java

## Deliverables

Interface specifications, the source files and any test code â€“ preferably in a github / bitbucket public repo.

The solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
* Correctness
* Code structure
* Data structures
* Extensibility
* Maintainability
* Test coverage
* Performance
